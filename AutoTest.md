# AutoTest

### Details to follow.

You will be able to submit your assignment for validation against the private test suite only once every 12 hours. The private suite will return limited information about the first failure it encounters. Since this suite is rate limited, it is highly recommended you extend the public suite to make your code as robust as possible before testing it against the private suite.
