# UBC CPSC 310 - Software Engineering
## September - December 2016

#Waitlist: [See Here](#waitlist)

### Overview

The world runs on software and CPSC 310 is all about taking the skills and knowledge you learned in CPSC 210 (Software Construction) and extending your skills to enable you to design and build non-trivial software systems. The course will involve a signficant challenging project that we will start working on in the first lecture and will continue to evolve until the last week of class.

Classes will be highly interactive and will involve working with your project partner (and soemetimes teaming up with other groups as well). While some reading materials will be posted online, most of the in-class material will not be available outside of class.

Some of the topics we will cover in 310 this term include:

* REST & Async Programming
* Software Specifications
* Agile Development
* Design (lots here!)
* Refactoring
* Information Security

### Project

The project is an integral part of this course. The projet will be difficult and time consuming. Projects will be completed in pairs (everyone **must** have a partner). You should expect the project to take ~6 hours / week / person (13 weeks * 2 people * 6 hours = 156 hours). It is extremely important you not leave project deliverables until the last moment.

The project will represent a 'full stack' web development project developed using Node. You are free to use Javascript, Typescript, or Coffeescript for your assignments, but the packages you use will be strictly limited. Each project deliverable will be marked using an automated private test suite; you will have access to a public automated test suite as well. While the public test suite will enable you to test that your project conforms to the interface of the private suite it will be insufficient to gague how complete your solution is. You are encouraged to create a private fork of the public test suite and extend it yourself to further validate each deliverable. Additional details will be given on the [AutoTest](AutoTest.md) page.


#### Allowable pacakges

The packages you can use are limited. The packages below, and the packages they require, are all you are permitted to use. It is notable that a database is **NOT** permitted to be used; the data in this course is sufficiently simple for in-memory manipulation using the features built into the programming language.

* [restify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify)
* [jszip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jszip)

#### Deliverables

The project will proceed in a series of four sprints. Each deliverable builds on the prior submission evolving your project from a small seed into a fully-fledged system.

1. Deliverable 1 (Due September 26 @ 0800)

---TBD---

1. Deliverable 2 (Due October 17 @ 0800)

---TBD---

1. Deliverable 3 (Due November 7 @ 0800)

---TBD---

1. Deliverable 4 (Due November 28 @ 0800)

---TBD---


#### Assessment

Engineers use automated test suites to validate that their software is working as expected. We will evaluate your project deliverables similarly using [AutoTest](AutoTest.md).

In addition to AutoTest, each team member will be independently asked a small number of questions in the lab to assess their understanding of the solution. While it is reasonable for team members to be more knowledgable about different parts of the system, it is expected that you will understand your entire solution at a high level and be able to provide spcific in-depth insight to some meaningful components of your solution.

### Grading

* Midterm 20%
* Project 40% 
* Final 40%

To pass the course and receive credit you must achieve a passing grade on **both** the project and the final exam.

## Policies

<a name="waitlist"></a>
### Waitlist

There is extremely high demand for this course this term. If you are on the waitlist and wish to join the class, please come to the front after **EVERY** class to sign in. Those students who have signed into every class by September 16 will be forwarded to the advisors who will insert students into available spots by the add/drop deadline. This does not guarantee you will be admitted, but without signing in every class you will not be elligible. Students on the waitlist should not form groups with students who are already enrolled in case your whole group does not make it into the course this term.

#### Accommodation

Lab attendance is mandatory. If you must miss a lab, please notify your TA directly; your overall project mark will reflect your participation.
If you are sick and unable to write the midterm, please contact Reidas soon as possible -- provide medical documentation.
Students who miss the final exam due to illness should consult the Faculty of Science Policy on missed exams. Note that students who do  not have suffiicient standing during the term may not qualify for academic concession if they miss the final.
Students who require dispensation based on their unique circumstances should refer to the UBC policy on Academic Concessions.
Cell phones, calculators, translators, and all other electronic devices are prohibited on desks during exams. They must be turned off and placed in your bag or on the ground. Students who need exam accommodation must make an official request to the Access and Diversity Office.

#### Academic Conduct

Each student is responsible for understanding and abiding by the University and Departmental policies on academic conduct. Specifically:

* [UBC policy on Academic Misconduct](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959)
* [Computer Science Department Lab policies and responsibilities](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/our-department/administration/policies/collaboration)

#### Respectful Environment

Everyone involved with CPSC 310 is responsible for understanding and abiding by the University's Respectful Environment Statement.

The Statement of Principle of UBC's Respectful Environment Statement is "The best possible environment for working, learning and living is one in which respect, civility, diversity, opportunity and inclusion are valued. Everyone at the University of British Columbia is expected to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds these principles in all communications and interactions with fellow UBC community members and the public in all University-related settings."
