## About the labs

This is a pair-programming course: If you want to work with someone specific for your project, be sure that both of you register for the _SAME_ lab section. We do not have the ability to move people around between labs; please either monitor the SSC for space in your preferred lab sections, move to another lab with space, or find a partner in the lab you are registered in. Teams **must** be firm by the time of your lab the week of the add/drop deadline. If you do not have a partner, it is your responsibility to notify the TA in lab that week so you can be paired up. If you do not have a partner at the end of your lab that week, you will not be able to complete the project (40% of your final grade). Finding a partner is **your** responsibility and is key to your having a great term, please take the time to do this right.

## Course request forms

Unforutnately, we cannot sign course registration forms. If you have any questions about registration, please contact the [CS advisors](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/resources/academic-advising).
