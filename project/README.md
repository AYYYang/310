# Project: TBD

TBD

## Deliverables

1. [Deliverable 1](Deliverable1.md) (Due September 26 @ 0800)

1. [Deliverable 2](Deliverable2.md) (Due October 17 @ 0800)

1. [Deliverable 3](Deliverable3.md) (Due November 7 @ 0800)

1. [Deliverable 4](Deliverable4.md) (Due November 28 @ 0800)

## Language

Your project will have to be JavaScript ES5 compatible; you can write it in either pure JS, CoffeeScript, or TypeScript (we will use TypeScript in lecture).

## Allowable packages

The packages you can use are limited. The packages below, and the packages they require, are all you are permitted to use. It is notable that a database is **NOT** permitted to be used; the data in this course is sufficiently simple for in-memory manipulation using the features built into the programming language.

* [restify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify)
* [jszip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jszip)

## Assessment

Each deliverable will evaluated in two ways:

* [AutoTest](AutoTest.md) compliance.
* Oral questions (in lab).

The weighting of these criteria will vary from deliverable to deliverable. The best way to succeed with the AutoTest aspect of the grade is to:

1. Create a private fork of the public AutoTest suite to run locally on your machine (as you can run this as often as you wish). 

1. Do a test submit with AutoTest to make sure you at least pass the public tests when we run it on our infrastructure.

1. Extend your fork of the public suite with additional tests that more comprehenisively test your code against the project requirements.

1. When you believe your suite to be effective, submit it to be run against the private suite. Remember: you can only submit to the private suite once every 12 hours!

For the oral questions, make sure both teammates have a clear understanding of how the system works at a high level (the major components, data structures, design decisions, and algorithms). Each team member should also be able to clearly describe their individual techincal contributions to the deliverable.
