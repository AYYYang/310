## Allowable packages

The packages you can use are limited. The packages below, and the packages they require, are all you are permitted to use. It is notable that a database is **NOT** permitted to be used; the data in this course is sufficiently simple for in-memory manipulation using the features built into the programming language.

* [restify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify)
* [jszip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jszip)
