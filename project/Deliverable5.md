# Deliverable 5

Software systems are long-lived. As such, it is typically unacceptable for old code to just stop working because new features have been added. To account for this, we will wrap up your project by running a complete regression test suite against your project code.

On the Deliverable 4 due date, the master branch of your repo will be run against the [Deliverable 1](Deliverable1.md), [Deliverable 2](Deliverable2.md), and [Deliverable 3](Deliverable3.md), AutoTest suites. Your score will be computed by:

```number of passed tests / total number of tests```

Any code that does not compile will count towards the total number of tests (and obviously the passing count will be 0 for those tests). Any tests that skipped will also count towards the total number of tests.

This deliverable should not require any work on your behalf, but it is crucial that you keep on top of your repos and make sure you do not have any major regressions before the due date. This date will be absolutely firm.
